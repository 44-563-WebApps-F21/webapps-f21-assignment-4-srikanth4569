    <h3>The Duchess of Padua</h3>
    <h4>_A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
        the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
        of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
        canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
        the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
        the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
        gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.</h4><br>

   <h4 class="duke">DUKE</h4>

  <p class="speech"> Then you should bless the taxes
    Which make you temperate.<br></p>


   <h4 class="duchess">DUCHESS</h4> 

 <p class="speech"> Think, while we sit
   In gorgeous pomp and state, gaunt poverty
   Creeps through their sunless lanes, and with sharp knives
   Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily
   And no word said.<br></p>

   <h4 class="thirdCitizen">THIRD CITIZEN</h4>

<p class="speech"> Ay! marry, that is true,
   My little son died yesternight from hunger;
   He was but six years old; I am so poor,
   I cannot bury him.<br></p>

   <h4 class="duke">DUKE</h4>

   <p class="speech">If you are poor,
   Are you not blessed in that?  Why, poverty
   Is one of the Christian virtues, 
  <p class="stage-direction">[_Turns to the_ CARDINAL.]</p>
   Is it not?
     I know, Lord Cardinal, you have great revenues,
   Rich abbey-lands, and tithes, and large estates
   For preaching voluntary poverty.<br></p>

   <h4 class="duchess">DUCHESS</h4> 

   <p class="speech"> Nay but, my lord the Duke, be generous;
   While we sit here within a noble house
   [With shaded porticoes against the sun,
   And walls and roofs to keep the winter out],
   There are many citizens of Padua
   Who in vile tenements live so full of holes,
   That the chill rain, the snow, and the rude blast,
   Are tenants also with them; others sleep
   Under the arches of the public bridges
   All through the autumn nights, till the wet mist
   Stiffens their limbs, and fevers come, and so— <br></p>

   <h4 class="duke">DUKE</h4>

   <p class="speech"> And so they go to Abraham’s bosom, Madam.
   They should thank me for sending them to Heaven,
   If they are wretched here. 
   <p class="stage-direction">[_To the_ CARDINAL.]</p>
   Is it not said
   Somewhere in Holy Writ, that every man
   Should be contented with that state of life
   God calls him to?  Why should I change their state,
   Or meddle with an all-wise providence,
   Which has apportioned that some men should starve,
   And others surfeit?  I did not make the world.<br></p>

   <h4 class="firstCitizen">FIRST CITIZEN</h4> 
   <p class="speech" >  He hath a hard heart.<br></p>

   <h4 class="secondCitizen">SECOND CITIZEN</h4> 
    <p class="speech">Nay, be silent, neighbour;
   I think the Cardinal will speak for us. <br></p>

   <h4 class="cardinal">CARDINAL</h4> 
  <p class="speech">  
    True, it is Christian to bear misery,
   Yet it is Christian also to be kind,
   And there seem many evils in this town,
   Which in your wisdom might your Grace reform. <br></p>
